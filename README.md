# -Four-basic-shapes-OpenGL-window

This code draws four basic shapes in an OpenGL window:

White Rectangle: A white rectangle is drawn with its corners at the following coordinates:

Bottom-left: (0.1, 0.1)

Bottom-right: (0.4, 0.1)

Top-right: (0.4, 0.4)

Top-left: (0.1, 0.4)

Red Triangle: A red triangle is drawn with its corners at:

Bottom-left: (0.6, 0.2)

Bottom-right: (0.8, 0.2)

Top: (0.7, 0.5)

Blue Trapezoid: A blue trapezoid is drawn with the following vertices:

Bottom-left: (0.2, 0.6)

Bottom-right: (0.5, 0.6)

Top-right: (0.4, 0.8)

Top-left: (0.3, 0.8)

Green Pentagon: A green pentagon is drawn with the following vertices:

Bottom-left: (0.7, 0.6)

Bottom-right: (0.9, 0.6)

Mid-right: (0.85, 0.75)

Top: (0.75, 0.85)

Mid-left: (0.65, 0.75)

These shapes are rendered with distinct colors: white, red, blue, and green, on a black background.
